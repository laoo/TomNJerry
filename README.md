## Unfinished Jaguar RISC simulator

At the moment only DSP is working and there is no easy way to use the simulation because, as the subtitle says, it's unfinished.

To see what it does grab the Windows release and run Jerry.exe to generate DSP output wave or JerryLogger.exe to see the main purpose of the tool - the log of RISC instruction flow through the pipeline. Should the self-explanatory.

The sample is using Ericde45's LSP from 42bs' [YARC reloaded](https://github.com/42Bastian/JaguarDemos/tree/main/yarc_reloaded) with Bastian's modifications.

It's public domain where not noted otherwise.
